Credit Card Transactions SQL Analysis Project

**Project Overview**

This SQL project explores a real-world dataset of credit card transactions across Indian cities. It answers complex business questions using SQL techniques such as CTEs, window functions, aggregations, and filtering. The goal is to derive insights into customer behavior, spend patterns, and card performance.

The project is part of a personal data portfolio to showcase business analytics thinking and advanced SQL skills.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset consists of one main table: credit_card_transcations, with the following columns:

transaction_id: Unique identifier of the transaction

city: City where transaction occurred

transaction_date: Date of the transaction

card_type: Type of card used (Gold, Platinum, Silver, Signature)

exp_type: Type of expense (Bills, Fuel, etc.)

gender: Gender of cardholder (M/F)

amount: Amount spent in the transaction

**Business Questions Answered**

Top 5 cities by credit card spends and their percentage of total spend

Highest spending month for each card type

First transaction to cross 1,000,000 cumulative spend per card type

City with lowest percentage spend using Gold cards

For each city, find highest and lowest expense types

Female spend contribution by each expense category

Card and expense type combo with highest MoM growth in Jan 2014

On weekends, which city had highest spend-to-transaction ratio?

Which city reached its 500th transaction the fastest?

**Skills Demonstrated**

SQL CTEs and window functions (ROW_NUMBER, SUM OVER)

Month-over-month growth analysis

Gender-based segmentation and contribution

Ranking and filtering using subqueries

Time series and cumulative analysis

Data quality filters (non-zero, valid joins)

**Business Insights**

Identify high-spend cities and card types for promotions

Analyze expense preferences by geography

Understand female purchasing behavior across categories

Optimize campaigns for card-expense type combinations

Detect spend surges or growth opportunities
